god i wish i had a job.
got it to add players! not sure it is, no, i know it isn't making the class.  but i have enough data to init the player and gamesession.

you can't put a null or empty object onto realtime.  you have to push a thing.  that was annoying

UCF Effects:
    need to decide on immunity.
    acceptable loss: needs a way to deactivate itself ya heard.


// need an aftereffects await that happens before score.  teleporter needs it to update the previous next id's and all that
// acc loss needs it for deactivating the last card

okay, TELEPORTER goofed up the previous ojb stuff.  it is time for the other update phase.

yeah, it is time for the post card update.  secondary update before score is calculated.  do clean up stuff

// teleporter works correctly with nanobots because it thinks its a card.   not sure if thats bad.  it might be fine lol

//for venice, what if you had a card that let you could play anywhere (any order) on the field, and you could play cards of 2 or less on it.  you could
play a healer boy on it?
