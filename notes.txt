god i wish i had a job.
got it to add players! not sure it is, no, i know it isn't making the class.  but i have enough data to init the player and gamesession.

UCF Effects:
    need to decide on immunity.
    acceptable loss: needs a way to deactivate itself ya heard.


// need an aftereffects await that happens before score.  teleporter needs it to update the previous next id's and all that
// acc loss needs it for deactivating the last card
